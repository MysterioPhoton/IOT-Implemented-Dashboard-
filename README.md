## The technology behind boiler and cooler system  is simple yet complex. As it runs on on/off system, but it does not give option to remotely control it . It also does not provide users to set the temperature to their accordance. Regardless of whether the temperature is adjusted correctly, it might overheat or underheat, causing harm to the goods. For example, if we do not monitor the heater and it overheats, the heating tank may burst. This can result in fatalities and injuries. The heat from the boiler is also utilised to shape the goods. If the temperature rises over the optimal level, the products may melt. If the problem persists, it will have an impact on output, and in exceptional cases, production may be discontinued. Industries may be forced to shut down permanently as a result of this. To make industry sustainable and to ease man suffering from unintentional error it is important to address this problem.  The problem is to stop industry malfunction of production. Which  can be solved using  IoT to remotely turn off the Boiler and turn on the Cooler. Hence the main goal of the project is to make Smart dashboard that can control Production boiler and cooler system without or with manpower.
